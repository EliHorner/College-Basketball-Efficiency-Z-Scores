# College-Basketball-Efficiency-Z-Scores
Contains code for taking T-Rank data and creating Z-scores, as well as output files containing the efficiency stats in their regular form and as Z-scores.

## Z Scores
Z scores are a helpful way to tell us how many standard deviations from the mean a value is. For example, a Z score of 1.7 means that the value we are looking it is 1.7 standard devaitions above the mean.

## Book keeping
For this project, all of the data has been scaled such that a positive Z score is always "good" and a neagtive one is always "bad," even though in some cases, a lower raw number may be better. THis has been done to make it easier to quickly interpret the scores, since a higher score always indicates a more efficient team in each category.
